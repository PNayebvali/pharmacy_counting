# Methodology

I have used Python to solve this challenge. The problem asks for a simple group by operation but with native data structures. We can use itertools groupby Methodology that comes standard with python. In this case we need to run the groupby operation on text file fully in memory. Instead I decided to calculate with my own algorithm while reading each line.
I read lines from the file and check to see if that datapoint has unique prescriber and new drug_name. Based on the result I update the output dictionary and unique_id.

# Tests

There are 6 tests to check the code under different scenarios (including the base case of insight). Each test does the following:

* test_1: Base test by insight
* test_2: Data case sensitivity check:  All the float columns are case insensitive
* test_3: Sort check: Tests the sorts and their directions according to the specification
* test_4: Header case sensitivity check and Extra columns: The code is case insensitive in headers and can handle extra columns at the end
* test_5: Multiple extra columns and columns reorder: The code is capable of reading in the a file that has it is column order changed from default. As long as all the columns required for groupby are available, the groupby process should go smoothly
* test_6: Blank lines: All the blank lines at the beginning, in the middle or at the end of the file will be skipped
 
# Instructions

We designed this coding challenge to assess your coding skills and your understanding of computer science fundamentals. They are both prerequisites of becoming a data engineer. To solve this challenge you might pick a programing language of your choice (preferably Python, Scala, Java, or C/C++ because they are commonly used and will help us better assess you), but you are only allowed to use the default data structures that come with that programming language (you might use I/O libraries). For example, you can code in Python, but you should not use Pandas or any other external libraries.

***The objective here is to see if you can implement the solution using basic data structure building blocks and software engineering best practices (by writing clean, modular, and well-tested code).***

# Output

Your program needs to create the output file, `top_cost_drug.txt`, that contains comma (`,`) separated fields in each line.

Each line of this file should contain these fields:
* drug_name: the exact drug name as shown in the input dataset
* num_prescriber: the number of unique prescribers who prescribed the drug. For the purposes of this challenge, a prescriber is considered the same person if two lines share the same prescriber first and last names
* total_cost: total cost of the drug across all prescribers

For example

If your input data, **`itcont.txt`**, is
```
id,prescriber_last_name,prescriber_first_name,drug_name,drug_cost
1000000001,Smith,James,AMBIEN,100
1000000002,Garcia,Maria,AMBIEN,200
1000000003,Johnson,James,CHLORPROMAZINE,1000
1000000004,Rodriguez,Maria,CHLORPROMAZINE,2000
1000000005,Smith,David,BENZTROPINE MESYLATE,1500
```

then your output file, **`top_cost_drug.txt`**, would contain the following lines
```
drug_name,num_prescriber,total_cost
CHLORPROMAZINE,2,3000
BENZTROPINE MESYLATE,1,1500
AMBIEN,2,300
```

These files are provided in the `insight_testsuite/tests/test_1/input` and `insight_testsuite/tests/test_1/output` folders, respectively.


# Tips on getting an interview

## Writing clean, scalable and well-tested code

As a data engineer, it’s important that you write clean, well-documented code that scales for a large amount of data. For this reason, it’s important to ensure that your solution works well for a large number of records, rather than just the above example.

<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fxtTLR_Z5fTO-Y91BnKOQd6J0VC9gPO3/view?usp=sharing">Here</a> you can find a large dataset containing over 24 million records. Note, we will use it to test the full functionality of your code, along with other tests.

It's also important to use software engineering best practices like unit tests, especially since data is not always clean and predictable.

Before submitting your solution you should summarize your approach and run instructions (if any) in your `README`.

You may write your solution in any mainstream programming language, such as C, C++, C#, Go, Java, Python, Ruby, or Scala. Once completed, submit a link of your Github or Bitbucket repo with your source code.

In addition to the source code, the top-most directory of your repo must include the `input` and `output` directories, and a shell script named `run.sh` that compiles and runs the program(s) that implement(s) the required features.

If your solution requires additional libraries, environments, or dependencies, you must specify these in your `README` documentation. See the figure below for the required structure of the top-most directory in your repo, or simply clone this repo.

## Repo directory structure

The directory structure for your repo should look like this:

    ├── README.md
    ├── run.sh
    ├── src
    │   └── pharmacy-counting.py
    ├── input
    │   └── itcont.txt
    ├── output
    |   └── top_cost_drug.txt
    ├── insight_testsuite
        └── run_tests.sh
        └── tests
            └── test_1
            |   ├── input
            |   │   └── itcont.txt
            |   |__ output
            |   │   └── top_cost_drug.txt
            ├── your-own-test_1
                ├── input
                │   └── your-own-input-for-itcont.txt
                |── output
                    └── top_cost_drug.txt

**Don't fork this repo** and don't use this `README` instead of your own. The content of `src` does not need to be a single file called `pharmacy-counting.py`, which is only an example. Instead, you should include your own source files and give them expressive names.

## Testing your directory structure and output format

To make sure that your code has the correct directory structure and the format of the output files are correct, we have included a test script called `run_tests.sh` in the `insight_testsuite` folder.

The tests are stored simply as text files under the `insight_testsuite/tests` folder. Each test should have a separate folder with an `input` folder for `itcont.txt` and an `output` folder for `top_cost_drug.txt`.

You can run the test with the following command from within the `insight_testsuite` folder:

    insight_testsuite~$ ./run_tests.sh

On a failed test, the output of `run_tests.sh` should look like:

    [FAIL]: test_1
    [Thu Mar 30 16:28:01 PDT 2017] 0 of 1 tests passed

On success:

    [PASS]: test_1
    [Thu Mar 30 16:25:57 PDT 2017] 1 of 1 tests passed



One test has been provided as a way to check your formatting and simulate how we will be running tests when you submit your solution. We urge you to write your own additional tests. `test_1` is only intended to alert you if the directory structure or the output for this test is incorrect.

Your submission must pass at least the provided test in order to pass the coding challenge.

For a limited time we also are making available a <a href="http://ec2-18-210-131-67.compute-1.amazonaws.com/test-my-repo-link">website</a> that will allow you to simulate the environment in which we will test your code. It has been primarily tested on Python code but could be used for Java and C++ repos. Keep in mind that if you need to compile your code (e.g., javac, make), that compilation needs to happen in the `run.sh` file of your code repository. For Python programmers, you are able to use Python2 or Python3 but if you use the later, specify `python3` in your `run.sh` script.
